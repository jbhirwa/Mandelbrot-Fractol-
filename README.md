# Mandelbrot-Fractol-
The Mandelbrot set is created with the following function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(z)%20=%20z^{2}%20%2B%20c">, here c is a complex number. For a complex number (z) to be within the Mandelbrot set it must remain stable within a certain number of iterations. Stability of z with the additive c is achieved when z stays within -2 and 2  on the r axis for (n) iterations. Complex numbers that stay within this bound are black, while numbers that escape the bound are given a colour- the colour is determined by when z escaped. Most complex numbers within the Mandelbrot set  stabilise within 50 iterations, as shown with the image below.
