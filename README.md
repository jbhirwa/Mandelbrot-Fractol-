# Mandelbrot-Fractol-
The Mandelbrot set is created with the following function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(z)%20=%20z^{2}%20%2B%20c">, here c is a complex number. For a complex number (c) to be within the Mandelbrot set it must remain stable within (n) iterations. Complex numbers for the additive c achieve stability when (c) stays within -2 and 2 on the r axis after n iterations, usually visualized as a plane described by a real axis (r) and an imaginary axis (i). Complex numbers that stay within this bound are black (and thus part of the Mandelbrot set), while numbers that escape the bound are given a colour(resulting in colourful patterns)- the colour is determined by when z escaped, as shown in figure one. Most complex numbers within the Mandelbrot set stabilise within 50 iterations, as shown with figure two.
