# Mandelbrot-Fractol-
The Mandelbrot set is created with the following function {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}, $$f(z) = x^2+c$$ where c is a complec number. For a complex number to be within the Mandelbrot set it must remain stable within a certain number of iterations. Stability of z with the additive c is achieved when z stays within -2 and 2 for (n) iteration. Complex numbers that stay within this bound are black, while numbers that escape the bound are given any colour- the colour is determined by when z escaped.
