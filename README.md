# What is the Mandelbrot set?
The Mandelbrot set is created with the following function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(z)%20=%20z^{2}%20%2B%20c">, here c is a complex number. For a complex number (c) to be within the Mandelbrot set it must remain stable within (n) iterations. Complex numbers for the additive c achieve stability when (c) stays within -2 and 2 on the r axis after n iterations, usually visualized as a plane described by a real axis (r) and an imaginary axis (i). Complex numbers that stay within this bound are black (and thus part of the Mandelbrot set), while numbers that escape the bound are given a colour(resulting in colourful patterns)- the colour is determined by when z escaped, as shown in figure one. Most complex numbers within the Mandelbrot set stabilise within 50 iterations, as shown with figure two. For further information please watch the videos from the links found at the bottom of this document.

# Understanding the 42 MLX library
It is be best to start off with the first link as it does a decent job of introducing the main functions of the mlx library, as well as, walk you through some very simple programs. The second link is a big link dump to resources to almost any problem you might face, but it also has the man for most of the functions. The last two are mini projects walkthroughs, they were extremely helpful once I had a decent understanding of the functions.
